# DocumentalService

This project is an initial attempt to create a documental service that, in perspective, should provide an API (don't know what kind of) similat to the one used by systems like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.

By this first commit, it is simply a collection of methods that simulate the touch, mkdir, ls and cd commands of a Unix command line.
I used this approach to have an initial simply way to deal with file management and not to lost with devil early design optimization.
